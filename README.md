- Filter them / Sort them;
- Create our own new breed.

### Installation and Setup Instructions
1. Installation: npm install on both the api and the client folders

2. Remember to create and setup the file api/.env to run the Back-End correctly. You will need your Postgres credentials, create a new DB on your computer and also get an ApiKey from *(The Dog Api)[https://thedogapi.com/]*.

3. In both the api and the client directory, you can run: npm start.

This will run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
